# SUPERVISED LEARNING 

We refer as supervised learning by creating an agent that learn from the real x-y displacement needed, this real displacement is computed as follows
we know at "t", that the target is placed at T_t and the player is located at P_t, then the real displacement needed is T_t - P_t :
